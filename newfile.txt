This is a new file I'm adding to a new branch.

I'm adding some lines and I'll even paste in some text:

You may have noticed we didn't go over any commands on branching. For now, 
we want you to understand the concept of branches in git, and not worry 
about using them. Git can get complicated pretty quickly, so it's 
important to understand the concepts first.
